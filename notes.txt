Everything in the world is a computer and every computer has an ip.
So we need to connect to another computer (server).

Internet is nothing but a big wire connection for transferring of data.

Once we type google the call will go to our ISP ->DNS(Domain nam system) and that will give us the ip of google and then dns connect to it and then back to isp and then back to us

There should be only one h1 in the page

Dont skip a level like from h1 dont go directly to h3(h2 should be also there)

Headings, paragraph are non void elements

void element you are forbidden to keep any content.It looks like <hr/>
<hr/>(Horizontal Rule Element drwas a line)

<br/>(break)

<ul></ul>->create bullet points of list items

<ol></ol>->create items with numbers

<li></li> ->List item

Anchor tag <a>This is link</a> but we need to add an attribute to this so that the hyperlink will work.the attribute in this case href

<a href="https://www.google.com">this is the link</a>

Image tag <img/> img us a void tag attribut is src an alt


Current directory ./

previous directory ../

next directory directoy/file


Boiler Plate HTML

<!DOCTYPE html> which says the version of html
<html lang="en"> where we write actual html
<head> important information about the website is written which is not displayed to the user 
  <meta charset="UTF-8"> meta tag setting all the characters to UTF-8
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>  title is the text written on top of the tab
</head>
<body> where we will create the page 
   
</body>
</html>


Cascading style sheets

1.CSS
2.Sass
3.Less and manymore

3 ways of adding css 
1.Inline 2.Internal<style> 3.External <link>  

Class selector .
Element selector h1
Id selector #(should be unique and only used once in one html)
Attribute selector p[draggabale] select the html element and the attribute.You can use attribute value also to do the css

* means applied everywhere


1px=1/96 inch =0.26mm wide and tall
1pt =1/72 inch =0.35mm wide and tall
1em->it is talking the full size of the parent.lets say body has 20px and in that h1 =1 em then it is also 20 px
1rem->it is taking the size of root.

font-weight:normal,bold,lighter,bolder(relative to parent +100 from parent),number(100-900)
font-family:if spaces in b/w write in quotes 


border :thickness style colour (adds to the outside of the element)
height and width of box doen't change with change in border
border-width:top right bottom left we can set as top-bottom right-left

padding: adds gap b/w the element and the border

margin:the gap b/w border and any other content on screen is called margin



css order depends on position specificity type importance

position->lower down is more important

specificity->id>attribute>className>element

type->inline>internal>external

importance-> !important (if we write this everything wil get overridden)
